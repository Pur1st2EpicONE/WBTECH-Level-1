## L1.13

This Go snippet demonstrates three different ways to swap the values of two integers.

The program first initializes two integer variables and prints their initial values.

It then swaps the values using Go's multiple assignment syntax, which is the simplest and most idiomatic way in Go.

Next, it demonstrates swapping using the XOR bitwise operation, which does not require a temporary variable.

Finally, it shows swapping using arithmetic operations, another method that avoids an extra variable but requires caution to prevent overflow.
