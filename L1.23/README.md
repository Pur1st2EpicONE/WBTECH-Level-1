## L1.23

This Go snippet demonstrates two ways to remove an element from a slice: manually using copy and using the standard library function slices.Delete.

The delete function creates a new slice with length one less than the original. It first copies all elements before the target index and then copies all elements after the target index into the new slice. Finally, it replaces the original slice with the new one.

The slicesDelete function uses slices.Delete from the Go standard library, which performs the same operation in a concise, built-in way.
